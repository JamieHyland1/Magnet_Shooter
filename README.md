# Magnet shooter
Magnet shooter is a top down shooter in the vein of games like smash tv, it doesn't have a title thus far and is primarily is a project to get me familiar with GM2.

#### Aim of the game
The aim of magnet shooter is to defend yourself against a horde of enemies using a variety of different tools. Players have a dash to teleport through enemie flanks, turrets to slow enemies down and magnet bullets to pull your enemies along a set path.
